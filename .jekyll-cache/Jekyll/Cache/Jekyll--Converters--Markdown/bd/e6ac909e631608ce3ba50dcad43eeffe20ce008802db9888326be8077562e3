<p>Iâ€™m a graduate student who loves game music so much. I was used to be a heavy gamer of 2D dot pixel graphic game. Meanwhile, I am a dilettante musician. I like playing violin, piano, guitar and sometimes I compose music. So, by joining two interests, <strong>Iâ€™m studying game music generation</strong>. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on the 80s retro game music. I love the chiptune and generated sound of the synthesizer at that time.</p>

<p>In more general and large scope, my research interest and question are the harmonization of each instrument in <strong>multi-track symbolic music generation</strong>, and how to make machine learn and understand the composition rules of human-created music.</p>
