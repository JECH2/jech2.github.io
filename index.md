Hi, there! I am a person who loves game music so much. I was used to be a heavy gamer of 2D dot pixel graphic game. Meanwhile, I am a dilettante musician. I like playing violin, piano, guitar and sometimes I compose music. So, by joining two interests, I'm studying game music generation. Currently, I'm focusing on the 80s retro game music genre. I love the chip tune and generated sound of the synthesizer at that time ;)
In more general and large scope, my research interest and question are the harmonization of each instrument in multi-track music generation, and how to make machine learn and understand the composition rules of human-created music.
