Iâ€™m a graduate student who loves game music so much. I was used to be a heavy gamer of 2D dot pixel graphic game. Meanwhile, I am a dilettante musician. I like playing violin, piano, guitar and sometimes I compose music. So, by joining two interests, **I'm studying game music generation**. Currently, I'm focusing on the 80s retro game music. I love the chiptune and generated sound of the synthesizer at that time.

In more general and large scope, my research interest and question are the harmonization of each instrument in **multi-track symbolic music generation**, and how to make machine learn and understand the composition rules of human-created music.
